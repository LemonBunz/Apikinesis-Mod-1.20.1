This Java Minecraft mod (supposedly) allows you to control bees... yeah bees... 
Why bees, you ask? IDK, I thought it sounds fun...

Planned Features: 
- Passive Skill/s
- Active Skills - Most skills require the player - the "Apikinetic" - to be near a bee or beehive to use.
  but certain tools may bypass this limitation. Apikinetics cannot create bees.
  - Summon Bee
  - Command Bees
  - Summon Swarm
  - More...
- Bee Personalities and Emotions.
- Bee Variants
- Maybe more... Whatever. 

(PS. I got this idea while dreaming in my sleep)
